<strong>Front-end</strong>

Import the project to an IDE of your choice, make sure you have the latest version of node.js and angular 17 installed, 
then run the command <code>npx json-server db.json</code> to run the json-server server to simulate the backend, 
and then run the <code>npm install</code> commands to download the necessary dependencies and to run the application run the command <code>ng s</code>.

obs.: On another occasion, if you have a different version of Angular installed on your machine, you can run the application in the environment 
with the command <code>npx npm install</code> and then <code>npx ng s</code>, any version of Node.js that comes with npm 5.2.0 or higher will support the npx command.
